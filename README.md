# Q - IBM Qiskit project

I have developed an interest in quantum computing for quite a while now. This project marks the beginning of my adventure on pursuing the journey of a field known as quantum computing. Why Qiskit? The answer is simple - I love IBM (previously considered working at IBM for quite a while). This also marks my journey towards specialisation - something i am beginning to figure out.

Several codeblocks of code written with the qiskit library. Do note, that typically, qiskit coding is done in Jupyter notebooks (refer to `src`).

Please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary packages before beginning.

## Contents

### `setup.ipynb`

Get your token at [IBM Quantum](https://quantum.ibm.com). Set the value of the `TOKEN` variable as your token. Run all the codeblocks in order.

Quick side note: You do only need to run the codeblocks **once** since codeblock 4 saves your channel and token to the environment.

### `helloworld.ipynb`

A "Hello world" example using the IBM Qiskit library. I followed the Qiskit tutorial for this one, and will be toying around with qiskit myself once I have gotten use to this and understand the concepts better. Run all the codeblocks in order.
